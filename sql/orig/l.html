Last words: &quot;It doesn't look very fast; we can easily swim across.&quot;
Last words: &quot;It has an ejector seat? I pull the lever.&quot; {in a helicopter-like Flybot}
Last words: &quot;It probably just wants to be friends.&quot;
Last words: &quot;It seems easy enough&quot;
Last words: &quot;It'd be stupid to trap this!&quot;
Last words: &quot;It's dangerous, but think of the experience points.&quot;

Last words: &quot;Oops.&quot;
Last words: &quot;Quick !! How does one UNSUMMON a demon lord ?&quot;
Last words: &quot;Quick!  What did that scroll say ?&quot;
Last words: &quot;Read it to me.&quot; {It was a fireball scroll.}
Last words: &quot;Remember that demon that you HAD imprisoned down in the cellar ?  Well...&quot;
Last words: &quot;Run away!&quot;
Last words: &quot;Sacrifice...?&quot;
Last words: &quot;Say, what's that red dot on your forehead?&quot;  {laser sight}
Last words: &quot;So that giant fell into the pit?  I'll jump over it and get his treasure.&quot;
Last words: &quot;So they have a tank...big deal! I have an M-16!!! I can kill it.&quot;
Last words: &quot;So what?&quot;
Last words: &quot;Something's wrong with my d20.&quot;
Last words: &quot;Stand back you wimps.  I'll kill it.&quot;
Last words: &quot;Stop!&quot;
Last words: &quot;Sure you can use the LRM Carrier platoon in this scenario .&quot;
Last words: &quot;Switch to 2nd Edition? Okay, what the hell...&quot;
Last words: &quot;Take out a Beholder's eyes, and Bingo!&quot;
Last words: &quot;That fire wand only had 25 charges left on it ?!&quot;
Last words: &quot;That was no healing potion!  I'm gonna kill that swindler!&quot;
Last words: &quot;That's only a statue&quot;
Last words: &quot;The warding circle for this demon wasn't continuous before, was it ?&quot;
Last words: &quot;Then I'll hit him back!&quot; {spoken at the start of a bar brawl.}
Last words: &quot;There is no trap on the door, so let's open it&quot;
Last words: &quot;There is only two left...&quot;
Last words: &quot;There's no way they'll ever find us.&quot;
Last words: &quot;They can't possibly outflank us.  We have a multi-scanner!&quot;
Last words: &quot;They can't see me.  I'm invisible!&quot;
Last words: &quot;They don't look so tough.&quot;
Last words: &quot;They need a twenty to hit me, I'm invincible&quot;
Last words: &quot;They will flee in terror from my &quot;
Last words: &quot;They're only kobolds!&quot;
Last words: &quot;This 250' wall has so many holes, it should be easy to climb.&quot;
Last words: &quot;This is a push-over dungeon.&quot;
Last words: &quot;This trap only hits one time. Trust me, I'm sure.&quot;
Last words: &quot;This type of undead can't drain levels&quot;
Last words: &quot;Those noises are probably nothing.&quot;
Last words: &quot;Trap? What trap?&quot;
Last words: &quot;Trust me. I know what I'm doing&quot;
Last words: &quot;Trust me.&quot;
